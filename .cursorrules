# Cursor Rules for Job Finder Project

## Model Selection Strategy

This project uses a multi-model approach to optimize quality and efficiency:

### Model Assignments:
- **Gemini 3**: UI/UX design, visual layouts, user experience, design decisions
- **Opus 4.5**: Coding, backend logic, architecture, complex implementations, business logic
- **GPT-5.1**: Debugging, error fixing, code review, troubleshooting, optimization

### When to Use Each Model:

**Use Gemini 3 when:**
- Designing UI components and layouts
- Creating color schemes and typography
- Planning user flows and experiences
- Making visual design decisions
- Creating mockups or wireframes
- User research and requirements

**Use Opus 4.5 when:**
- Writing code (frontend or backend)
- Implementing features and functionality
- Designing architecture and system structure
- Complex problem solving
- Business logic implementation
- Database design
- API development
- Integration work

**Use GPT-5.1 when:**
- Debugging errors and bugs
- Fixing code issues
- Code review and refactoring
- Performance optimization
- Troubleshooting problems
- Analyzing error logs
- Security vulnerability fixes

## Project Context

**Project Name**: Job Finder Platform  
**Type**: Web Application  
**Purpose**: Platform for job seekers and employers to connect

## Coding Standards

- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- Follow component-based architecture
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first)
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include error handling and validation
- Document complex logic

## File Structure Preferences

- Organize by feature/domain, not by file type
- Keep components reusable and modular
- Separate concerns (UI, logic, data)
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Communication Preferences

- When requesting tasks, specify which model should be used
- For multi-phase tasks, break them down by model assignment
- Always mention if switching models mid-task
- Document design decisions made with Gemini 3 for reference

## Example Request Format

```
"Design the job listing card component using Gemini 3"
"Implement the search functionality using Opus 4.5"
"Debug the API error using GPT-5.1"
```

## Notes

- Model switching must be done manually in Cursor's UI
- This file serves as a reminder of model preferences
- Adjust model assignments as needed based on project needs
- Keep track of which model was used for each major decision
